    "section": "2.2 Application",
    "text": "2.2 Application\nRemote sensing is achieved by detecting the ground target, acquiring information about the target, and then processing the information acquired so that it can understand and describe the target, it acquires information through sensors. The sensors collect information from the surface of the ground which is the electromagnetic waves radiated from the surface of any feature and the reflected incident electromagnetic waves.\nOne application of this is the analysis of remotely sensed imagery through the reflectance of a feature’s wave spectrum. The reflectance spectrum of an object is limited to the ultraviolet, visible and infrared bands, especially the latter two. The characteristics of an object’s reflectance spectrum depend largely on the choice of wavelength at which the object interacts with the incident radiation. As shown in the figure below, the reflectance spectra of four features - citrus, tomato, maize and cotton - have different shapes(Brady 2021). The different reflectance of features in different wavelengths makes it easy to think of using multiple wavelengths for feature detection, such as multi-spectral scanners and other sensors for feature spectral analysis and identification, and through the fusion of remote sensing data from multiple sources and false color synthesis, which is becoming an important way of processing remote sensing images. It is also because of the characteristic that different features have different reflectance at different wavelengths that the reflectance curves of objects are widely used in the analysis and evaluation of remote sensing images as a physical basis for interpretation and classification.\n\n\n\nCharacteristic curves of reflection spectra of four plants(梁 et al. 2022)\n\n\nSatellite radar images and ancillary information can also be used in other areas. For example, we can use it to detect flood areas at their peak and evaluates its potential with mapping. The procedure wass tested on the catastrophic flood that occurred in Italy. Two ERS-1 synthetic aperture radar(SAR) images were processed, one acquired one month before the flood and the other acquired three days after the event. Visual interpretation and two different thresholding techniques were performed. The flood map derived shows only a small fraction of the satellite overpass. To overcome this limitation, the authors developed a new method to estimate the flooded area at the peak time by integrating the flooded area from SAR imagery with digital topographic data from GIS technique(Brivio et al. 2002).\n\n\n\nTemporal relationships between flood event(“2021 UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Provisional Figures” 2021)\n\n\nSome recent studies also shown UAV remote sensing techniques have many applications. Like spatial ecology, forest studies and other monitoring applications(‘Unmanned aerial vehicles for environmental applications’,2017). Before the development of UAVs, the majority of spectral datasets was made by satellites and manned aircraft(Aasen et al. 2018). By the rapidly developing technology, many new types of sensors make data quality assurance. For example, this picture shows the process from collect information to make data product(Aasen et al. 2018)."

It is its comprehensive nature that makes it such an interesting discipline, and with the help of remote sensing technology we are able to see the world from a different perspective.\nFor example, through PCA analysis. We can obtain remote sensing images that highlight the required elements, which helps us to carry out further analysis on a large scale. When doing the practical in this chapter, I always had some minor problems in the process of using snap, such as the failure to recognize the formulae in the next step due to resampling failure, and sometimes computer memory problems in the calculation, which I did not find at the beginning and only solved through many attempts.\n\n\n\n\n“2021 UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Provisional Figures.” 2021.\n\n\nAasen, Helge, Eija Honkavaara, Arko Lucieer, and Pablo Zarco-Tejada. 2018. “Quantitative Remote Sensing at Ultra-High Resolution with UAV Spectroscopy: A Review of Sensor Technology, Measurement Procedures, and Data Correction Workflows.” Remote Sensing 10 (7): 1091. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10071091.\n\n\nBrady, Maria. 2021. “Remote Sensing for Dummies.” ArcGIS StoryMaps. https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/cb1577b0f5bc485c974b4ea19d52282d.\n\n\nBrivio, P.

It is well known and documented that urbanisation can have significant effects on local weather and climate. Of these effects one of the most familiar is the urban heat island, for which the temperatures of the central urban locations are several degrees higher than those of nearby rural areas of simialr elevation. As a rapidly growing city in South Asia, it would be worsen in a warming city.\nAs one of the hottest city in India. The city of Ahmedabad is in the largest district in the western Indian state of Gujarat. With a population of 7.2 million and rapid growth in the real estate, automotive, and pharmaceutical sectors, Ahmedabad is among the top ten fastest growing cities in India, and is poised to become one of India’s leading metropolises by 2020.\nAt the time of the 2010 heat wave, the population of Ahmedabad was no better protected than those of other major South Asian cities. HAPs are comprehensive extreme heat early warning systems and prepardness plans. They typically include a range of mitigation and adaptation measures aimed at reducing health impacts in both the short and longer term. Their goal is to improve public awareness, expedite community outreach, facilitate coordincation across sectors, support capacity building for health care professionals, promote adaptation efforts, and reduce heat exposure, illness, and death."

These errors reduce the quality of the remote sensing data and the accuracy of the image analysis. Therefore it is necessary to pre-process the remote sensing images before the actual image analysis and processing. In this week, we mainly focused on corrections and data joining and enhancement. In corrections part, it includes geometric correction, atmospheric correction, orthorectification/topographic correction and radiometric correction. Image joining can help us combine several image for the analysis of bigger area and image enhancements can improve the visual appearance or results. In the practical, we tried to use landsat data to do some analysis, first we should correction and merge image, and then highlight the area with healthy vegetation. Finally, we did PCA analysis."

    "text": "3.2 Application\nIn the processing and analysis of remote sensing imagery, raw remote sensing data often contain such severe geometric distortions that they are difficult to integrate with other data. Each EO image acquisition system produces unique geometric distortions in its original images, so that the geometry of these images in their own local coordinate system does not correspond to other images, terrain and the user’s particular map projection. The sources of distortion can be divided into two main categories: the observer, the acquisition system, and the observed. In addition to these distortions, distortions associated with map projections need to be considered (Toutin, 2011).\nPre-processing is the initial and most basic image operation, correcting image distortions that occur during the image data acquisition process and restoring image quality. The elimination of geometric distortion is called geometric correction and the elimination of radiation distortion is called radiometric correction. In practice, atmospheric correction and topographic correction are usually carried out. The diagram below is an example of a geometric correction, the operations of which require geometrical mathematics and elevation information for better geolocation (Toutin, 2011).\n\n\n\nImage rectification to project the uncorrected image into the ground reference system: the geometric(Left) and radiometric(right) operations\n\n\nObservations of tropical rainforest vegetation dynamics using satellite-based remote sensing data are presented in a paper. There is some uncertainty in the data due to atmospheric corrections and cloud cover. In their study they used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and derived composites (MYDO9A1, MCD43A4 and MYD13A2 - vegetation indices) on board the Aqua satellite with results obtained from the Atmospheric Multi Angle Implementation for Correction (MAIAC) algorithm to assess these uncertainties. MAIAC employs a new cloud screening technique, as well as a new aerosol retrieval and atmospheric correction procedure based on time series and spatial analysis. Their results show a considerable improvement in surface reflectance and a 10-fold reduction in image noise levels using the MAlAC treatment(Hilker et al., 2012).\nFor image mosaics, when our study area exceeds the coverage of a single remote sensing image, it is often necessary to stitch together two or more images to form a larger image or series of images that cover the whole area, and this is the process of image mosaics.\nThe goal of image enhancement is to highlight relevant thematic information and improve the visual impact of the image; the goal of image transformation is to make it easier for the analyst to identify the content of the image and extract more useful information from it. Both are usually carried out after image correction and reconstruction, particularly where various types of noise in the original image must be removed."

In this study, MODIS surface temperature data products are used and a probabilistic threshold algorithm is introduced to improve the spatial identification accuracy of urban heat island patches. Based on this, an urban heat island expansion index is constructed to decompose the spatial and temporal change process of urban heat island patches into flying terrain, edge type, infill type and shrinkage type patterns. Based on the land use change process, the path analysis of the spatial expansion pattern of urban heat island patches is carried out to accurately identify the sources and trends of the spatial expansion path of urban heat island patches.\nThis study shows that the area of the diurnal urban heat island patches in Beijing in the summer of 2020 will be 3932km² and 2266km² respectively, accounting for 23.96% and 13.81% of the total area of Beijing. The proportion of diurnal urban heat island patch area increases by 43.40% and 24.44% respectively between 2005 and 2020 in summer. The area of growing urban heat island patches is greater than the area of shrinking urban heat island patches. The edge-type sprawl pattern is the most dominant pattern for growing urban heat island patches. Arable land, urban building land and rural settlements are the main spatial expansion paths for growing urban heat island patches. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis and data support to reveal the formation process of urban thermal environment and its fine management (Jon et al., 2022)."

In one paper, the author used support vector machines for classification in remote sensing. This paper reports the results of two experiments in which multi-class SVMs are compared with maximum likelihood (ML) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods in terms of classification accuracy. And the results show that the SVM achieves a higher level of classification accuracy than either the ML or the ANN, then we can use SVM with high-dimensional data and small training datasets(Pal and Mather, 2005).\nIn another study, the authors used decision tree regression for soft classification of remote sensing data. In recent years, decision tree classification has been widely used to classify land cover from remote sensing data. In this paper, the authors employ a decision tree regression approach to determine class proportions within a pixel so as to produce soft classification from remote sensing data(Xu et al., 2005)."

However, spatial structural relationships and contextual semantic information features are ignored.\nObject-oriented remote sensing image classification, the smallest unit of processing is no longer an image element, but an image object composed of multiple adjacent image elements containing more semantic information, and the geometric information of the object is used more in the classification than just the spectral information of a single object (Blaschke, 2010).\nIn related research, Geographical Object Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) refers to a class of digital remote sensing image analysis methods that study geographical entities or phenomena by depicting and analysing image objects rather than individual pixels. Image objects are usually represented by clusters of similar neighbouring pixels that share a common reference or meaning. A unique feature of GEOBIA, compared to traditional pixel-by-pixel modelling methods, is that image objects (usually from segmentation) - rather than individual pixels - become the basic unit of analysis because they represent “meaningful” geographical entities or phenomena at multiple scales (Chen et al., 2018).\n\n\n\nSource:Geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA): emerging trends and future opportunities"
