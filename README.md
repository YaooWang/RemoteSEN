Hi AndyÔºÅ I had some problems with github when I finally rendered the Learningdiary, I tried to fix it but was unsuccessful. Not trying the github platform multiple times before committing was a huge mistake on my part. You can see my content in the LearningDiary.pdf file in the repo, and I apologise for any inconvenience caused. Thanks.
