	abstract = {Land-use and land-cover maps of Atlanta Metropolitan Area in Georgia were produced from Landsat MSS and TM images for 1973, 1979, 1983, 1987, 1992, and 1997, spanning a period of 25 years. Dramatic changes in land use and land cover have occurred, with loss of forest and cropland to urban use. In particular, low-density urban use, which includes largely residential use, has increased by over 119 percent between 1973 and 1997. These land-use and land-cover changes have drastically altered the land surface characteristics. An analysis of Landsat images revealed an increase in surface temperature and a decline in NDVI from 1973 to 1997. These changes have forced the development of a signiﬁcant urban heat island effect at both the urban canopy and urban boundary layers as well as an increase in ground level ozone production to such an extent that Atlanta has violated EPA’s ozone level standard in recent years. Using canonical correlation analysis, surface temperatures and NDVI, extracted from Landsat TM images, were found to correlate strongly with volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, the two ingredients that form ozone by reacting with sunlight, but only weakly with the rates of cardiovascular and chronic lower respiratory diseases, which also did not exhibit strong correlation with VOC and NOx emissions, possibly because other factors such as demographic and socio-economic may also be involved. Further research is therefore needed to understand the health geography and its relationship to landuse and land-cover change. This paper illustrates the usefulness of a remote sensing approach for this purpose.},

The purpose of this study was to characterise the complete urban heat island in magnitude and spatial extent without the use of in situ measurements and to determine whether a correlation exists between heat island magnitude and rural temperature. The urban heat island magnitude was found to be inversely correlated with rural temperature, while the spatial extent was found to be independent of both heat island magnitude and rural temperature.},

	abstract = {Recurrent heat waves, already a concern in rapidly growing and urbanizing South Asia, will very likely worsen in a warming world. Coordinated adaptation efforts can reduce heat’s adverse health impacts, however. To address this concern in Ahmedabad (Gujarat, India), a coalition has been formed to develop an evidence-based heat preparedness plan and early warning system. This paper describes the group and initial steps in the plan’s development and implementation. Evidence accumulation included extensive literature review, analysis of local temperature and mortality data, surveys with heat-vulnerable populations, focus groups with health care professionals, and expert consultation. The findings and recommendations were encapsulated in policy briefs for key government agencies, health care professionals, outdoor workers, and slum communities, and synthesized in the heat preparedness plan. A 7-day probabilistic weather forecast was also developed and is used to trigger the plan in advance of dangerous heat waves. The pilot plan was implemented in 2013, and public outreach was done through training workshops, hoardings/billboards, pamphlets, and print advertisements. Evaluation activities and continuous improvement efforts are ongoing, along with plans to explore the program’s scalability to other Indian cities, as Ahmedabad is the first South Asian city to address heat-health threats comprehensively.},

To facilitate these applications, accurate sensor-derived Rrs is required. In this study, we assess atmospheric correction schemes, including NASA's NIR-SWIR approach, Acolite's NIR and SWIR approaches and the cloud-shadow approach. We provide the ﬁrst comprehensive evaluation for Landsat-8 Rrs retrievals in optically shallow coral reefs, along with an investigation of Landsat-8 Rrs products in a temperate turbid embayment. The obtained Landsat-8 Rrs data products are evaluated with concurrent in situ hyperspectral Rrs measurements. Our analyses show that the NASA and the cloud-shadow approaches generated reliable Rrs products across shallow coral reefs and optically deep waters. This evaluation suggests that high quality Rrs products are achievable from the Landsat-8 satellite in optically shallow environments, which supports further application of Landsat-8 type measurements for coral reef studies.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.rse.2017.07.016},
	abstract = {Standard atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms work well in open ocean areas where the water inherent optical properties (IOPs) are correlated with pigmented particles. However, the IOPs of turbid coastal waters may independently vary with pigmented particles, suspended inorganic particles, and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). In turbid coastal waters standard AC algorithms often exhibit large inaccuracies that may lead to negative water-leaving radiances (Lw) or remote sensing reﬂectance (Rrs). We introduce a new atmospheric correction algorithm for coastal waters based on a multilayer neural network (MLNN) method. We use a coupled atmosphere-ocean radiative transfer model to simulate the Rayleigh-corrected radiance (Lrc) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and the Rrs just above the surface simultaneously, and train a MLNN to derive the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Rrs directly from the TOA Lrc. The method is validated using both a synthetic dataset and Aerosol Robotic Network – Ocean Color (AERONET–OC) measurements. The SeaDAS NIR algorithm, the SeaDAS NIR/SWIR algorithm, and the MODIS version of the Case 2 regional water - CoastColour (C2RCC) algorithm are also included in the comparison with AERONET–OC measurements. The performance of the AC algorithms is evaluated with four statistical metrics: the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient (R), the average percentage difference (APD), the mean percentage bias, and the root mean square difference (RMSD). The comparison with AERONET–OC measurements shows that the MLNN algorithm signiﬁcantly improves retrieval of normalized Lw in blue bands (412 nm and 443 nm) and yields minor improvements in green and red bands compared with the other three algorithms. On a global scale, the MLNN algorithm reduces APD in normalized Lw by up to 13\% in blue bands and by 2–7\% in green and red bands when compared with the standard SeaDAS NIR algorithm. In highly absorbing coastal waters, such as the Baltic Sea, the MLNN algorithm reduces APD in normalized Lw by more than 60\% in blue bands compared to the standard SeaDAS NIR algorithm, while in highly scattering coastal waters, such as the Black Sea, the MLNN algorithm reduces APD by more than 25\%. These results indicate that the MLNN algorithm is suitable for application in turbid coastal waters. Application of the MLNN algorithm to MODIS Aqua images in several coastal areas also shows that it is robust and resilient to contamination due to sunglint or adjacency effects of land and cloud edges. The MLNN algorithm is very fast once the neural network has been properly trained and is therefore suitable for operational use. A signiﬁcant advantage of the MLNN algorithm is that it does not need SWIR bands.},

	abstract = {In the last 10 years, development in robotics, computer vision, and sensor technology has provided new spectral remote sensing tools to capture unprecedented ultra-high spatial and high spectral resolution with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This development has led to a revolution in geospatial data collection in which not only few specialist data providers collect and deliver remotely sensed data, but a whole diverse community is potentially able to gather geospatial data that ﬁt their needs. However, the diversiﬁcation of sensing systems and user applications challenges the common application of good practice procedures that ensure the quality of the data. This challenge can only be met by establishing and communicating common procedures that have had demonstrated success in scientiﬁc experiments and operational demonstrations. In this review, we evaluate the state-of-the-art methods in UAV spectral remote sensing and discuss sensor technology, measurement procedures, geometric processing, and radiometric calibration based on the literature and more than a decade of experimentation. We follow the ‘journey’ of the reﬂected energy from the particle in the environment to its representation as a pixel in a 2D or 2.5D map, or 3D spectral point cloud. Additionally, we reﬂect on the current revolution in remote sensing, and identify trends, potential opportunities, and limitations.},

	abstract = {Tropical rainforests are signiﬁcant contributors to the global cycles of energy, water and carbon. As a result, monitoring of the vegetation status over regions such as Amazônia has been a long standing interest of Earth scientists trying to determine the effect of climate change and anthropogenic disturbance on the tropical ecosystems and its feedback on the Earth's climate. Satellite-based remote sensing is the only practical approach for observing the vegetation dynamics of regions like the Amazon over useful spatial and temporal scales, but recent years have seen much controversy over satellite-derived vegetation states in Amazônia, with studies predicting opposite feedbacks depending on data processing technique and interpretation. Recent results suggest that some of this uncertainty could stem from a lack of quality in atmospheric correction and cloud screening. In this paper, we assess these uncertainties by comparing the current standard surface reﬂectance products (MYD09, MYD09GA) and derived composites (MYD09A1, MCD43A4 and MYD13A2 — Vegetation Index) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua satellite to results obtained from the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm. MAIAC uses a new cloud screening technique, and novel aerosol retrieval and atmospheric correction procedures which are based on time-series and spatial analyses. Our results show considerable improvements of MAIAC processed surface reﬂectance compared to MYD09/MYD13 with noise levels reduced by a factor of up to 10. Uncertainties in the current MODIS surface reﬂectance product were mainly due to residual cloud and aerosol contamination which affected the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): During the wet season, with cloud cover ranging between 90\% and 99\%, conventionally processed NDVI was signiﬁcantly depressed due to undetected clouds. A smaller reduction in NDVI due to increased aerosol levels was observed during the dry season, with an inverse dependence of NDVI on aerosol optical thickness (AOT). NDVI observations processed with MAIAC showed highly reproducible and stable inter-annual patterns with little or no dependence on cloud cover, and no signiﬁcant dependence on AOT (p b 0.05). In addition to a better detection of cloudy pixels, MAIAC obtained about 20–80\% more cloud free pixels, depending on season, a considerable amount for land analysis given the very high cloud cover (75–99\%) observed at any given time in the area. We conclude that a new generation of atmospheric correction algorithms, such as MAIAC, can help to dramatically improve vegetation estimates over tropical rain forest, ultimately leading to reduced uncertainties in satellite-derived vegetation products globally.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing (RS) systems have been collecting massive volumes of datasets for decades, managing and analyzing of which are not practical using common software packages and desktop computing resources. In this regard, Google has developed a cloud computing platform, called Google Earth Engine (GEE), to effectively address the challenges of big data analysis. In particular, this platform facilitates processing big geo data over large areas and monitoring the environment for long periods of time. Although this platform was launched in 2010 and has proved its high potential for different applications, it has not been fully investigated and utilized for RS applications until recent years. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively explore different aspects of the GEE platform, including its datasets, functions, advantages/limitations, and various applications. For this purpose, 450 journal articles published in 150 journals between January 2010 and May 2020 were studied. It was observed that Landsat and Sentinel datasets were extensively utilized by GEE users. Moreover, supervised machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, were more widely applied to image classification tasks. GEE has also been employed in a broad range of applications, such as Land Cover/land Use classification, hydrology, urban planning, natural disaster, climate analyses, and image processing. It was generally observed that the number of GEE publications have significantly increased during the past few years, and it is expected that GEE will be utilized by more users from different fields to resolve their big data processing challenges.},

	abstract = {Earth system science has changed rapidly due to global environmental changes and the advent of Earth observation technology. Therefore, new tools are required to monitor, measure, analyze, evaluate, and model Earth observation data. Google Earth (GE) was ofﬁcially launched by Google in 2005 as a ”geobrowser”, and Google Earth Engine (GEE) was released in 2010 as a cloud computing platform with substantial computational capabilities. The use of these two tools or platforms in various applications, particularly as used by the remote sensing community, has developed rapidly. In this paper, we reviewed the applications and trends in the use of GE and GEE by analyzing peer-reviewed articles, dating up to January 2021, in the Web of Science (WoS) core collection using scientometric analysis (i.e., by using CiteSpace) and meta-analysis. We found the following: (1) the number of articles describing the use of GE or GEE increased substantially from two in 2006 to 530 in 2020. The number of GEE articles increased much faster than those concerned with the use of GE. (2) Both GE and GEE were extensively used by the remote sensing community as multidisciplinary tools. GE articles covered a broader range of research areas (e.g., biology, education, disease and health, economic, and information science) and appeared in a broader range of journals than those concerned with the use of GEE. (3) GE and GEE shared similar keywords (e.g., “land cover”, “water”, “model”, “vegetation”, and “forest”), which indicates that their application is of great importance in certain research areas. The main difference was that articles describing the use of GE emphasized its use as a visual display platform, while those concerned with GEE placed more emphasis on big data and time-series analysis. (4) Most applications of GE and GEE were undertaken in countries, such as the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. (5) GEE is an important tool for analysis, whereas GE is used as an auxiliary tool for visualization. Finally, in this paper, the merits and limitations of GE and GEE, and recommendations for further improvements, are summarized from an Earth system science perspective.},

	abstract = {Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based geospatial processing platform for large-scale environmental monitoring and analysis. The free-to-use GEE platform provides access to (1) petabytes of publicly available remote sensing imagery and other ready-to-use products with an explorer web app; (2) high-speed parallel processing and machine learning algorithms using Google’s computational infrastructure; and (3) a library of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) with development environments that support popular coding languages, such as JavaScript and Python. Together these core features enable users to discover, analyze and visualize geospatial big data in powerful ways without needing access to supercomputers or specialized coding expertise. The development of GEE has created much enthusiasm and engagement in the remote sensing and geospatial data science fields. Yet after a decade since GEE was launched, its impact on remote sensing and geospatial science has not been carefully explored. Thus, a systematic review of GEE that can provide readers with the “big picture” of the current status and general trends in GEE is needed. To this end, the decision was taken to perform a meta-analysis investigation of recent peer-reviewed GEE articles focusing on several features, including data, sensor type, study area, spatial resolution, application, strategy, and analytical methods. A total of 349 peer-reviewed articles published in 146 different journals between 2010 and October 2019 were reviewed. Publications and geographical distribution trends showed a broad spectrum of applications in environmental analyses at both regional and global scales. Remote sensing datasets were used in 90\% of studies while 10\% of the articles utilized ready-to-use products for analyses. Optical satellite imagery with medium spatial resolution, particularly Landsat data with an archive exceeding 40 years, has been used extensively. Linear regression and random forest were the most frequently used algorithms for satellite imagery processing. Among ready-to-use products, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used in 27\% of studies for vegetation, crop, land cover mapping and drought monitoring. The results of this study confirm that GEE has and continues to make substantive progress on global challenges involving process of geo-big data.},

	abstract = {Barchan dunes are common on Earth, Mars and Titan. Previous studies have shown that their formation, migration and evolution are influenced by the wind regime and other factors, but details vary among regions. Understanding barchan morphology and migration will both improve our understanding of dune geomorphology and provide a basis for describing the environmental conditions that affect the formation and development of these dunes on Earth and other planets. Here, we provide detailed measurements of barchan dune migration in China’s Quruq Desert, in the lower reaches of the Tarim River. We monitored their migration direction and rate, and their morphological changes during migration, by comparing Google Earth images acquired in 2003 and 2014. The dunes migrated west-southwest, close to the local resultant drift direction. The migration rate averaged 8.9 to 32.1 m yearÀ1, with obvious spatial variation. In addition to the wind regime, the migration rate depended on dune morphology, density and vegetation cover; the rate was negatively related to dune height, density and vegetation cover, but positively linearly related to the length/width ratio (LU/W) and to the decrease in this ratio from 2003 to 2014. We found correlations among the dune morphometric parameters, but the relationships were weaker than in previous research. Due to the complexity of the factors that affect the processes that underlie sand dune development and migration, the morphological changes during dune migration were also complex. Our measurements suggest that the aeolian environment played a dominant role in dune migration and its spatial variation in the Quruq Desert. These results will support efforts to control dune migration in the western Quruq Desert and improve our understanding of dune morphodynamics. © 2019 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The strengths of machine learning include the capacity to handle data of high dimensionality and to map classes with very complex characteristics. Nevertheless, implementing a machine-learning classiﬁcation is not straightforward, and the literature provides conﬂicting advice regarding many key issues. This article therefore provides an overview of machine learning from an applied perspective. We focus on the relatively mature methods of support vector machines, single decision trees (DTs), Random Forests, boosted DTs, artiﬁcial neural networks, and k-nearest neighbours (k-NN). Issues considered include the choice of algorithm, training data requirements, user-deﬁned parameter selection and optimization, feature space impacts and reduction, and computational costs. We illustrate these issues through applying machine-learning classiﬁcation to two publically available remotely sensed data sets.},

Their implementation as a per-pixel based classifier to produce hard or crisp classification has been reported in the literature. Remote sensing images, particularly at coarse spatial resolutions, are contaminated with mixed pixels that contain more than one class on the ground. The per-pixel approach may result in erroneous classification of images dominated by mixed pixels. Therefore, soft classification approaches that decompose the pixel into its class constituents in the form of class proportions have been advocated. In this paper, we employ a decision tree regression approach to determine class proportions within a pixel so as to produce soft classification from remote sensing data. Classification accuracy achieved by decision tree regression is compared with those achieved by the most widely used maximum likelihood classifier, implemented in the soft mode, and a supervised version of the fuzzy cmeans classifier. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and fuzzy error matrix based measures have been used for accuracy assessment of soft classification.},

	abstract = {Spatial autocorrelation is inherent to remotely sensed data. Nearby pixels are more similar than distant ones. This property can help to improve the classification performance, by adding spatial or contextual features into the model. However, it can also lead to overestimation of generalisation capabilities, if the spatial dependence between training and test sets is ignored. In this paper, we review existing approaches that deal with spatial autocorrelation for image classification in remote sensing and demonstrate the importance of bias in accuracy metrics when spatial independence between the training and test sets is not respected. We compare three spatial and non-spatial cross-validation strategies at pixel and object levels and study how performances vary at different sample sizes. Experiments based on Sentinel-2 data for mapping two simple forest classes show that spatial leave-oneout cross-validation is the better strategy to provide unbiased estimates of predictive error. Its performance metrics are consistent with the real quality of the resulting map contrary to traditional non-spatial cross-validation that overestimates accuracy. This highlight the need to change practices in classification accuracy assessment. To encourage it we developped Museo ToolBox, an open-source python library that makes spatial cross-validation possible.},

	abstract = {Machine learning based classiﬁcation methods are widely used in geoscience applications, including mineral prospectivity mapping. Typical characteristics of the data, such as small number of positive instances, imbalanced class distributions and lack of veriﬁed negative instances make ROC analysis and cross-validation natural choices for classiﬁer evaluation. However, recent literature has identiﬁed two sources of bias, that can affect reliability of area under ROC curve estimation via cross-validation on spatial data. The pooling procedure performed by methods such as leave-one-out can introduce a substantial negative bias to results. At the same time, spatial dependencies leading to spatial autocorrelation can result in overoptimistic results, if not corrected for. In this work, we introduce the spatial leave-pair-out cross-validation method, that corrects for both of these biases simultaneously. The methodology is used to benchmark a number of classiﬁcation methods on mineral prospectivity mapping data from the Central Lapland greenstone belt. The evaluation highlights the dangers of obtaining misleading results on spatial data and demonstrates how these problems can be avoided. Further, the results show the advantages of simple linear models for this classiﬁcation task.},

In the case of a single target variable, the univariate approaches remain valid, but in the fully multivariate case where a vector of variables needs to be estimated, the evaluation needs to be based on all estimates simultaneously. An extension of cross-validation and associated performance measures to the fully multivariate case is presented and discussed for the case of regionalized compositions. The method is demonstrated by validating geostatistical models for two case studies: a sample drawn from a geochemical survey data set estimated with cokriging, and an application of direct sampling multiple-point simulation.},

	abstract = {土地利用变化体现地球表面资源的开发和利用程度,遥感影像是获取土地利用信息的数据源。通过遥感影像的解译快速获取大面积区域的土地利用现状,对掌握土地变化情况具有重要意义。目前遥感技术蓬勃发展,已积累了长时序的卫星影像,时间序列数据在土地利用分类中可以提供更多与时间相关的特性。同时,面向对象分类方法将分类目标由单一像素转化为均质对象,能生成更符合实际情况的多层次的地物边界,因此基于时间序列影像数据开展面向对象分类对土地利用类型解译具有重要意义。为构建适合具有黄土高原丘陵沟壑区典型特征的吴起县的面向对象分类方法,本文首先以Landsat 8 OLI和MODIS13Q1影像为数据源,提取多源NDVI(Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)数据,采用时空融合算法融合生成2018年23期具备高时空分辨率的NDVI时序数据;利用滤波函数对NDVI时序数据平滑,对比分析不同滤波函数的平滑效果,筛选出最适滤波算法;利用滤波后的NDVI时序数据提取物候影像,为分类提供更多的时间序列信息。其次构建了包含光谱、形状、纹理、遥感指数、地形、物候等多维特征体系,通过特征优选,筛选出最优特征组合。然后确定了面向对象分类中的关键参数,分析了不同波段的贡献程度,采用控制变量法确定了适合研究区特点的形状标准、紧致度因子等分割参数,构建出多尺度分割分类层次,利用贝叶斯分类(Bayes)、CART决策树分类(CART)、随机森林分类(Random Forest,RF)、支持向量机(Support Vector Machine,SVM)四种分类方法实现了不同地物的分层提取,最终构建出适合黄土高原丘陵沟壑区典型特征的面向对象分类方法。主要结论如下:(1)融合后的NDVI时序数据保留了Landsat和MODIS影像时空分辨率特点。Double Logistic滤波算法更适用于吴起县地形特点,平滑重构效果较好。(2)在特征权重评估、搜索优选、计算相关系数的基础上,实现了特征空间的降维,构建了涵盖光谱、形状、纹理、遥感指数、地形、物候的综合特征体系。(3)在增强近红外波段参与分割的权重后,确定了形状标准0.7,紧致度因子0.6等关键分割参数,形成了“分割-分类-合并-分割-分类”的多层次分类规则,构建了耕地-水域-林地、草地、建设用地的三层分类体系,最终确定了不同地物的最优分割尺度:耕地、水域分别为115、95,林地、草地、建设用地为65。(4)确定了RF分类是更适合吴起县特点的面向对象机器学习方法,总体分类精度达到92.13\%,Kappa系数达到0.90。Bayes分类对建设用地、水域、林地的效果较好;CART分类对林地、水域、草地区分度较高;RF分类中耕地、林地、草地、建设用地、水域均达到较高的制图精度;SVM分类在水域、耕地提取表现较好。},

	abstract = {Remote sensing imagery needs to be converted into tangible information which can be utilised in conjunction with other data sets, often within widely used Geographic Information Systems (GIS). As long as pixel sizes remained typically coarser than, or at the best, similar in size to the objects of interest, emphasis was placed on per-pixel analysis, or even sub-pixel analysis for this conversion, but with increasing spatial resolutions alternative paths have been followed, aimed at deriving objects that are made up of several pixels. This paper gives an overview of the development of object based methods, which aim to delineate readily usable objects from imagery while at the same time combining image processing and GIS functionalities in order to utilize spectral and contextual information in an integrative way. The most common approach used for building objects is image segmentation, which dates back to the 1970s. Around the year 2000 GIS and image processing started to grow together rapidly through object based image analysis (OBIA - or GEOBIA for geospatial object based image analysis). In contrast to typical Landsat resolutions, high resolution images support several scales within their images. Through a comprehensive literature review several thousand abstracts have been screened, and more than 820 OBIA-related articles comprising 145 journal papers, 84 book chapters and nearly 600 conference papers, are analysed in detail. It becomes evident that the first years of the OBIA/GEOBIA developments were characterised by the dominance of ‘grey’ literature, but that the number of peer-reviewed journal articles has increased sharply over the last four to five years. The pixel paradigm is beginning to show cracks and the OBIA methods are making considerable progress towards a spatially explicit information extraction workflow, such as is required for spatial planning as well as for many monitoring programmes.},

	abstract = {Several spectral unmixing techniques have been developed for subpixel mapping using hyperspectral data in the past two decades, among which the fully constrained least squares method based on the linear spectral mixture model (LSMM) has been widely accepted. However, the shortage of this method is that the Euclidean spectral distance measure is used, and therefore, it is sensitive to the magnitude of the spectra. While other spectral matching criteria are available, such as spectral angle mapping (SAM) and spectral information divergence (SID), the current unmixing algorithm is unable to be extended to these measures. In this paper, we propose a unified subpixel mapping framework that models the unmixing process as a best match of the unknown pixel's spectrum to a weighted sum of the endmembers' spectra. We introduce sequential quadratic programming to solve the nonlinear optimization problem encountered in the implementation of this framework. The main feature of this proposed method is that it is not restricted to any particular similarity measures. Experiments were conducted with both simulated and Hyperion data. The tests demonstrated the proposed framework's advantage in accommodating various spectral similarity measures and provided performance comparisons of the Euclidean distance measure with other spectral matching criteria including SAM, spectral correlation measure, and SID.},

	abstract = {Image segmentation is a critical and important step in (GEographic) Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA or OBIA). The final feature extraction and classification in OBIA is highly dependent on the quality of image segmentation. Segmentation has been used in remote sensing image processing since the advent of the Landsat-1 satellite. However, after the launch of the high-resolution IKONOS satellite in 1999, the paradigm of image analysis moved from pixel-based to object-based. As a result, the purpose of segmentation has been changed from helping pixel labeling to object identification. Although several articles have reviewed segmentation algorithms, it is unclear if some segmentation algorithms are generally more suited for (GE)OBIA than others. This article has conducted an extensive state-of-the-art survey on OBIA techniques, discussed different segmentation techniques and their applicability to OBIA. Conceptual details of those techniques are explained along with the strengths and weaknesses. The available tools and software packages for segmentation are also summarized. The key challenge in image segmentation is to select optimal parameters and algorithms that can general image objects matching with the meaningful geographic objects. Recent research indicates an apparent movement towards the improvement of segmentation algorithms, aiming at more accurate, automated, and computationally efficient techniques.},

	abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: Historical patterns of discrimination and disinvestment have shaped the current landscape of vulnerability to heat in U.S. cities but are not explicitly considered by heat mitigation planning efforts. Drawing upon the equity planning framework and developing a broader conceptualization of what equity means can enhance urban heat management. Here I ask whether areas in Baltimore (MD), Dallas (TX), and Kansas City (MO) targeted for disinvestment in the past through practices like redlining are now more exposed to heat. I compare estimates of land surface temperature (LST) derived from satellite imagery across the four-category rating system used to guide lending practices in cities around the United States, summarize the demographic characteristics of current residents within each of these historical designations using U.S. Census data, and discuss the connection between systematic disinvestment and exposure to heat. LST and air temperatures are not equivalent, which makes it difficult to reconcile existing research on the human health impacts of heat exposure that rely on a sparse network of air temperature monitoring stations with more granular LST data. Areas of these cities that were targeted for systematic disinvestment in the past have higher mean land surface temperatures than those that received more favorable ratings. Poor and minority residents are also overrepresented in formerly redlined areas in each of the three study cities. Takeaway for practice: By examining areas that have experienced sustained disinvestment, cities may be able to more quickly narrow the focus of heat mitigation planning efforts while furthering social equity. Efforts to mitigate the negative impacts of rising temperatures in U.S. cities must be tailored to the local climate, built environment, and sociodemographic history. Finally, geospatial data sets that document historical policies are useful for centering and redressing current inequalities when viewed through an equity planning lens.},

	abstract = {Place-based structural inequalities can have critical implications for the health of vulnerable populations. Historical urban policies, such as redlining, have contributed to current inequalities in exposure to intra-urban heat. However, it is unknown whether these spatial inequalities are associated with disparities in heat-related health outcomes. The aim of this study is to determine the relationships between historical redlining, intra-urban heat conditions, and heat-related emergency department visits using data from 11 Texas cities. At the zip code level, the proportion of historical redlining was determined, and heat exposure was measured using daytime and nighttime land surface temperature (LST). Heat-related inpatient and outpatient rates were calculated based on emergency department visit data that included ten categories of heat-related diseases between 2016 and 2019. Regression or spatial error/lag models revealed significant associations between higher proportions of redlined areas in the neighborhood and higher LST (Coef. = 0.0122, 95\% CI = 0.0039–0.0205). After adjusting for indicators of social vulnerability, neighborhoods with higher proportions of redlining showed significantly elevated heat-related outpatient visit rate (Coef. = 0.0036, 95\% CI = 0.0007–0.0066) and inpatient admission rate (Coef. = 0.0018, 95\% CI = 0.0001–0.0035). These results highlight the role of historical discriminatory policies on the disparities of heat-related illness and suggest a need for equity-based urban heat planning and management strategies.},

	abstract = {In the 1930’s the Federal Home Loan Bank Board established a program to appraise real estate risk levels in several cities. Four classes indicating level of security for real estate investments were developed: A (green) –best, B (blue) – still desirable, C (yellow) – declining, and D (red) – hazardous. Recent studies have shown that heat island effects are greater, imperviousness is higher, and tree cover lower in areas that were formerly red­ lined (class D). This paper analyzed all redlined areas in U.S. cities and confirms that redlined areas (class D) have lower tree cover, greater impervious cover and lower forest ecosystem service values than other classes, with tree cover declining and impervious cover increasing as security risk class increased. Nationally, tree cover averaged 40.1 percent in class A and 20.8 percent in Class D; impervious cover averaged 30.6 in Class A and 53.0 percent in Class D. Loss of annual ecosystem services in riskier redlined areas (classes B-D) compared to the highest rated zone (class A) conservatively equates to \$308 million nationally if classes B-D had the percent tree cover exhibited in Class A. At the city scale, these losses in foregone services can reach up to \$100 million per year (New York, NY). As percent tree cover and percent tree cover stocking declines as percent impervious cover increases, differences in the physical impervious structure of the redlined areas at the time of designation in­ fluence tree cover differences. As redlined areas were often delimited in areas with higher population density and impervious cover, these areas tend have lower tree cover today. Even if stocking levels were increased to levels exhibited in Class A (57.8\%) among all classes, tree cover would still decrease as class risk increases due to less available greenspace in lower graded classes. These patterns illustrate the importance of impervious cover on the distribution of ecosystem services and understanding the impacts of redlining practices. City policies could be directed to help offset these disparities by enhancing tree cover and reducing impervious cover in these underresourced areas.},

Anthropogenic landscape modiﬁcations expand coverage of impervious surfaces inducing the urban heat island (UHI) effect, a critical twenty ﬁrst century challenge associated with increased economic expenditure, energy consumption, and adverse health impacts. Yet, omission of UHI measures from global climate models and metropolitan planning methodologies precludes effective sustainable development governance. We present an approach that integrates Earth observation and climate data with three-dimensional urban models to determine optimal tree placement (per square meter) within proposed urban developments to enable more effective localized UHI mitigation. Such data-driven planning decisions will enhance the future sustainability of our cities to align with current global urban development agendas.},

	abstract = {Global warming has obtained more and more attention because the global mean surface temperature has increased since the late 19th century. As more than 50\% of the human population lives in cities, urbanization has become an important contributor for global warming. Pearl River Delta (PRD) in Guangdong Province, southern China, is one of the regions experiencing rapid urbanization that has resulted in remarkable Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, which will be sure to influence the regional climate, environment, and socio-economic development. In this study, Landsat TM and ETM+ images from 1990 to 2000 in the PRD were selected to retrieve the brightness temperatures and land use/cover types. A new index, Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBaI), was proposed to extract bare land from the satellite images. Additionally, Shenzhen, which has experienced the fastest urbanization in Guangdong Province, was taken as an example to analyze the temperature distribution and changes within a large city as its size expanded in the past decade. Results show that the UHI effect has become more prominent in areas of rapid urbanization in the PRD region. The spatial distribution of heat islands has been changed from a mixed pattern, where bare land, semi-bare land and land under development were warmer than other surface types, to extensive UHI. Our analysis showed that higher temperature in the UHI was located with a scattered pattern, which was related to certain land-cover types. In order to analyze the relationship between UHI and land-cover changes, this study attempted to employ a quantitative approach in exploring the relationship between temperature and several indices, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBaI) and Normalized Difference Build-up Index (NDBI). It was found that correlations between NDVI, NDWI, NDBaI and temperature are negative when NDVI is limited in range, but positive correlation is shown between NDBI and temperature.},
